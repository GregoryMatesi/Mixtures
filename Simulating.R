# "snpsampgen.R" contains a function that takes a new set of 100,000 SNP and uses those to simulate a sample population of size k.

# "SLSQPmixturesR.R" contains a function that feeds this sample population matrix into the SLSQP algorithm in R.

# "HA_script.py" contains a function that feeds this sample population matrix into the SLSQP algorithm in Python.

# At the end of every iteration of this loop will be printed the estimated pi-values, number of iterations, and time for both versions of SLSQP.

# The source scripts needed to execute this code can be found at https://github.com/GregoryMatesi/SimulationDesign

# Thanks to Ian for "snpsampgen.R" and "SLSQPmixturesR.R." And to Jordan for "HA_script.py."
